            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Jason Layton, a cybersecurity enthusiast transitioning from a decade-long career in Electronic Warfare with the US Navy. My journey into the world of cybersecurity is driven by a passion for protecting digital assets that are growing more important to our society everyday.
                With 10 years of experience in signals intelligence and threat detection, I've honed my analytical skills and attention to detail in an operational environment where the pressure is on. Now, I'm applying this expertise to the cybersecurity field, focusing on areas such as network security, incident response, and threat analysis.
                
                My recent experience includes:
                
                A rewarding internship as a SOC Analyst, where I've gained hands-on experience in threat detection, incident response, and security tool implementation.
                Developing Python scripts to automate cybersecurity tasks, demonstrating my commitment to efficiency and continuous improvement.
                Building and maintaining a comprehensive home lab where I experiment with various security tools and scenarios provided by TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and Cybrary.
                
                When I'm not immersed in the world of cybersecurity, you can find me working on cars and motorcycles and helping friends design and build their PCs. I'm also passionate about educating and protecting those vulnerable to cyber attacks.
                I hold a TS/SCI clearance and am finishing up the last few electives for a Bachelor's degree in Workforce Education from Southern Illinois University. My goal is to establish myself as a Cybersecurity professional and eventually work in security engineering.
                I'm always eager to connect with fellow cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss the latest in cyber threats, share experiences, or explore potential collaborations.
                Thank you for checking out my page and special thanks to Michael Ricci for inspiring this!.</p>
