                    <p>Cybersecurity Home Lab (07/23 ‚Äì Present)
- Conducted extensive Wireshark traffic analysis, overcoming challenges in identifying abnormal behaviors
across various protocols (ICMP, DNS, HTTPS). Developed skills in following data streams and recognizing
patterns of malicious activity, such as unusual payload sizes and covert data exfiltration attempts.
- While learning to configure ELK stack, practiced troubleshooting Elasticsearch configuration problems and
firewall settings. Gained experience in log ingestion, parsing, and visualization using Logstash and Kibana.
- Used Splunk Enterprise, overcoming initial difficulties with query syntax and data normalization. Developed
proficiency in creating custom dashboards, alerts, and reports for security monitoring and response.
- Configured Wazuh SIEM in a virtualized environment, overcame challenges with system requirements.
Gained experience in setting up agents, creating custom alert rules, and managing security events.
- Experimented with various Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Kali, Arch) for hosting security tools, developing
adaptability in working across different environments. Practiced deploying VMs via VirtualBox hypervisor.
- Applied the LM Cyber Kill Chain model in simulated environments using Atomic Red Team and Caldera,
overcoming challenges in setting up attack simulations and using results to improve defense strategies.
- Developed custom Python scripts for task automation, including a tool for comparing file hashes, removing
human-error, demonstrating ability to apply programming skills to practical cybersecurity challenges.
- Engaged in web application security testing using OWASP ZAP, learning to identify and mitigate common
vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) in a controlled environment.
- Practiced network enumeration and exploitation techniques using tools like Nmap, enum4linux, and
Metasploit, developing skills in identifying potential attack vectors from CVEs in simulated environments.
- Practiced digital forensics using Autopsy on Android device images, faced challenges with encrypted data
and deleted file recovery. Reconstructed user activities and identified potential security incidents.
- Engaged in malware analysis exercises, learning to use sandboxing techniques and analyze malicious
binaries' behavior in a controlled environment through Hybrid-Analysis, ANY.RUN, and VirusTotal.
- Gained hands-on experience with cloud services, particularly AWS EC2, learning to set up and secure
virtual machines, manage SSH access, and configure basic network security settings</p>
